Original Repo could be: `https://github.com/ARambazamba/AZ-204` where `ARambazamba` is the `original-owner-github-username` and `AZ-204` is the `reponame`

### Listing the current Remotes

List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

```
git remote -v

```

Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

### Adding the Repo of the original owner as Upstream
